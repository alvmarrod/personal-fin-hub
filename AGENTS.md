name: ste-writing
description: Rewrite prose (docs, READMEs, PR descriptions, error messages, release notes, comments, tool descriptions, system prompts — never code) into ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English to remove "AI slop". Use when asked to make writing not sound like AI, make docs clear or plain, enforce a controlled writing style, review text for STE violations, or write technical documentation that reads human. Two modes — strict (procedures/safety) and STE-flavored (general prose).

# ste-writing

Write prose in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English (Issue 9: 53 rules in 9 sections, 875 approved words). This applies to documentation, READMEs, pull-request text, error messages, release notes, comments, tool descriptions, system prompts, and agent-to-agent messages. It does not apply to code, identifiers, or command syntax. It is not for marketing copy, essays, or anything that needs a voice — STE strips voice on purpose.

Three ways to use it:

- **write** — produce new text in STE.
- **rewrite** — convert existing text to STE. Keep every fact.
- **review** — do not rewrite. Output a table (`Rule | Original | Simplified`), one row per violation, then one line on anything you left alone and why.

## Rules

Numbers in parentheses are rule numbers in ASD-STE100 Issue 9.

WORDS

- Use one name for one thing (1.11, 9.4). Do not rotate check / verify / validate / confirm for the same action — pick one and reuse it. Certified STE uses "make sure" or "examine".
- Use the short common word: start (not begin/commence/initiate), use (not utilize/leverage), help (not facilitate), make sure (not ensure/verify), do (not perform/conduct), give or supply (not provide), before (not prior to), after (not subsequent to), about (not regarding/concerning), get (not obtain/acquire), show (not demonstrate), also (not additionally/furthermore/moreover).
- Give each word one meaning (1.3). "fall" means to move down, not to decrease.
- No marketing adjectives: seamless, robust, powerful, cutting-edge, effortless, world-class, next-generation, revolutionary.
- American spelling (1.14).

VERBS

- Active voice. "the parser reads the file", not "the file is read by the parser". Procedures: always. Descriptive text: passive is permitted only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant (3.6).
- A past participle used as an adjective is not passive and is correct (3.3): "the valve is closed", "the field is required".
- Only simple tenses (3.2): infinitive, imperative, simple present, simple past, simple future. No present perfect: "we received the report", never "we have received the report".
- No stacked auxiliaries (3.4). Not "it is important to note that this may help to improve". Write "this improves X".
- Use a verb for an action (3.7): "analyze the log", not "perform an analysis of the log".
- No "-ing" main verb where a simple tense works (3.5).
- No phrasal verbs (9.3): spin up, dive into, kick off, roll out.

SENTENCES

- One instruction per sentence, unless two actions happen at the same time (5.2). Max 20 words (instruction, 5.1), max 25 (descriptive, 6.3).
- When a condition comes before its command, divide them with a comma (5.4): "If the test fails, read the log."
- Do not drop words to compress (4.2): "Remove the bolts from the panel", never "Remove bolts from panel". No contractions.
- When applicable, use an article (a, an, the) or a demonstrative adjective (this, these) before a noun (4.5) — the standard's qualifier included. Do not add articles to general statements or abstract concepts ("Solvents can cause damage to paint"). In a series of items, the article before the first noun is enough.
- Connect related sentences with plain connectors — then, but, thus, as a result (4.4). STE is short sentences, not disconnected ones.

NOUNS

- Multi-word nouns have at most three words (2.1). Unpack "the agent task queue priority handler" into "the handler that sets task-queue priority", or hyphenate.
- Define an abbreviation at first use, then use the abbreviation.

PUNCTUATION

- No semicolons (8.1). Write two sentences. (Note: the em dash is not banned by STE, only the semicolon is — add "no em dash" yourself if you want it gone.)

STRUCTURE

- One topic per paragraph (6.5), max six sentences (6.6). For steps, use a numbered vertical list, one action per item, imperative form. Put a condition before its command.
- A list item can be a label, not a sentence (a flow list, a changelog line, a feature bullet). Keep a label in its short form ("Frontend receives session JWT"). Do not expand a label into a sentence only to give it an article.
- Safety text (strict mode): WARNING = risk of injury, CAUTION = risk of damage, NOTE = information only, never an instruction (7.1, 5.5). Start with the command or condition, then give the risk (7.2, 7.3). Put it directly before the step it protects, not at the top of the procedure.

## Guards

- Never drop a fact, number, condition, or scope qualifier to satisfy a length cap. Keep the longer sentence and flag it.
- Preserve code identifiers, part numbers, units, error strings, and safety wording exactly.
- Change the smallest span that fixes a violation. Do not restyle text a rule does not touch.
- If the input already complies, return it unchanged and say so.
- Write only the requested text. No preamble, no summary, no closing remarks.

## Modes

- **strict** — procedures, runbooks, safety text, error messages: apply every rule and both length caps, plus the strict word set: but (not however), because (not since, for causes), can (not may), must (not should/shall), use or with (not using), obey (not follow, for instructions), push (not press, for physical controls). The spec's own list of the 39 most frequent writer errors is in [ste-recurring-errors.md](ste-recurring-errors.md).
- **STE-flavored** — general prose (READMEs, PR descriptions, docs): apply the sentence, paragraph, tense, active-voice, noun-cluster, and no-phrasal-verb discipline; relax the 875-word dictionary lockdown and the strict word set so the text keeps enough range to read naturally.

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**This project has a knowledge graph. Start with the code-review-graph
MCP tools to narrow scope, then read the source.** The graph is cheaper than scanning files and
gives you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file search cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes_tool` or `query_graph_tool` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius_tool` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes_tool` + `get_review_context_tool` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph_tool` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview_tool` + `list_communities_tool`

### Verify in the source

- Narrow scope with the graph, then read the source. Do not change code from graph output alone.
- For any non-trivial change, read the implementation and the relevant tests before concluding.
- Verify the exact source when touching behavior, database logic, migrations, retries, fallbacks,
  recovery, or compatibility code.
- When the graph and the source disagree, the source wins. The graph may be stale or may not
  model that relationship.
- An empty graph result can mean "not indexed" or "not statically visible", not "does not exist".

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes_tool` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context_tool` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius_tool` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows_tool` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph_tool` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes_tool` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview_tool` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes_tool` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows_tool` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph_tool` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
